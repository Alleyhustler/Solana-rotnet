Most people are
taught that the fastest algorithms are on the order of
<math><mi>Ο</mi><mo>(</mo><mn>1</mn><mo>)</mo></math>. Not even close. The fastest are
<math><mi>Ο</mi><mo>(</mo><mn>0</mn><mo>)</mo></math>.<p>What's <math><mi>Ο</mi><mo>(</mo><mn>0</mn><mo>)</mo></math>? It's the speed of not doing work. Most
of the software performance problems you're likely experiencing aren't slow algorithms, or even
shared resource contention, they're just waste. The vast majority of performance is being wasted
doing a bunch of work that nobody needed done. Some routine examples I find are things like
repeatedly serializing and deserializing or copying and reallocating objects that didn't need to be
copied. Wrapping something in a for-loop that involves overhead for each iteration that could be
eliminated by doing it in one go. Doing all sorts of make-work under the guise of "best practices,"
being able to handle "arbitrary" inputs, or satiate some sense of aesthetic taste.<p><math><mi>Ο</mi><mo>(</mo><mn>0</mn><mo>)</mo></math> is what happens if you stop solving imaginary
problems. It's what happens if you talk to your users/customers and find out what they
<em>actually</em> need done. It's leaving boundaries until after you understand what the code
actually needs to do instead of arbitrarily splitting up the problem over function calls, modules,
or network stacks right at the start.<p>I'm serious, most of the optimization work I do is making code run in
<math><mi>Ο</mi><mo>(</mo><mn>0</mn><mo>)</mo></math>. Simple example, there's a server that passes
data to another. That second system's only job is to put that data in a database and send a message
to yet another server. Don't ask me why, but it's a real example. Anyway, it was too slow. Accepting
the data and putting it in the database was taking over 10 seconds. Why is it taking this long? A
mountain of reasons, but the simplest was that it was
<abbr title="JavaScript Object Notation">JSON</abbr> deserializing the data and using
<abbr title="JavaScript Object Notation">JSON</abbr> schema to do input validation on a payload it
was getting from a trusted system. It then re-serialized it and put it in a database, storing the
data in a <abbr title="JavaScript Object Notation">JSON</abbr> column which caused the database to
again deserialize it and normalize it for storage.<p>Why was it doing all this work? "Best practices." It's just what services do. How did I fix it?
Accept the data as a binary payload and put it into a binary blob column. I'd have removed the whole
thing but I can only exert so much influence. Now it takes a couple seconds, basically all of it on
network overhead.<p>I find it funny just how much I constantly want to cut away at the system until it does only what it
really needs to. It's why I remember formatting and reinstalling my first
<abbr title=Microsoft>MS</abbr>-<abbr title="Disk Operating System">DOS</abbr> machine because it
was too cluttered. Why my Linux of choice has gone from Ubuntu to Arch to Void. Why I often replace
dependencies I added in the prototype with my own code once I understand what really needs to be
done.<p>When your computer is busy doing things you really don't need it to be doing, it's wasting your
time. It's a fun flame war to watch when people talk about how fast or slow a language or framework
is. Fast or slow software's first order approximation is based on the knowledge you have in doing
things that don't frivolously waste time.<p>I could type all day giving you example after example, but I'll just leave you with the
