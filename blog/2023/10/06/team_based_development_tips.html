We often study
techniques for dealing with code but gloss over techniques for dealing with other developers. Here's
just a couple of my routine patterns for getting things done in large teams.<h2><a id=burndown-development href=#burndown-development>Burndown Development</a></h2><p>When you have a large codebase and large team you often end up needing to change something that
exists in hundreds or thousands of places. You can't patch them all in one go. Additionally, as
you're trying to replace them all, you'll often find people keep introducing new changes that add to
the problem. To combat this, it's often best to create a burndown and work on the problem in small
steps.<p>This is usually just a test case or static analysis pass that's required to succeed as part of the
process of adding changes. Its job is to enumerate every instance of the old thing and fail if it
finds any. You then run it and collect every known instance of the existing thing. Add all those to
a list of ignored instances. When it finds someone adding a new one it explains that doing it the
old way is no longer allowed and provides info about the new way.<p>You've now got two resources. First you have a list of every single instance that needs updating and
can prune it as you go to chart your progress. You've also got a method to prevent the problem
getting any bigger.<h2><a id=gradual-automation href=#gradual-automation>Gradual Automation</a></h2><p>Ever had a step by step manual process and thought the computer should be able to do it? If you turn
that list into a program that displays each step, it can be. For each step, it prints the existing
instructions and waits for you to tell it to continue. Now as you have time you can automate just
one or two steps. Over time the number of manual steps required can shrink until the tool just does
the whole thing start to finish.<p>Often the barrier to automation is getting credential management setup so you can share
<abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr> credentials safely. You can see my posts
on this <a href=../../../2020/01/24/how_to_secure_application_credentials.html>problem</a> and a
possible <a href=../../../2020/10/31/decentralized_secret_management.html>solution</a> for more
information.<p>The harder barrier is often using tools that prevent automation altogether. Sometimes you can fix
this by emitting keyboard and mouse events. Often the best path here is to choose and use better
tools when possible. When it's not, you can at least tell the human to go deal with the tricky part
and report back needed details. I often find automating the clipboard here is your friend.<h2><a id=leaderboards href=#leaderboards>Leaderboards</a></h2><p>Want something measurable improved? Create a leaderboard to track who's improved it the most. This
can be things like dead code deletions, performance improvements, documentation writing, dependency
updates, <abbr title="et cetera; and so forth">etc.</abbr>.<p>Just be careful! If you publish the bottom of the board, it can lead to all sorts of negative
impacts. You also want to make sure that people gaming the system are still being productive. Think
before you publish. It's often vital that the initiative only live for a limited time to maximize
impact and minimize adverse effects.<h2><a id=ship-the-org-chart href=#ship-the-org-chart>Ship The Org-Chart</a></h2><blockquote><p>Any organization that designs a system (defined broadly) will produce a design whose structure
is a copy of the organization's communication structure.<footer>— <em>Conway's Law</em></footer></blockquote><p>This is also true over time. If your org keeps moving people around, your system will end up a big
ball of spaghetti. If you have high developer turnover, you end up with a lot of dead or zombie
code. If your system has discrete versions, they'll end up visible in the product like sedimentary
rock. To maximize architectural success, just ship your org-chart. This requires you to deeply
understand the actual communications structure of the organization and mirror it into the system.<p>Microservices work well at Amazon because their org-chart is huge, with a bunch of fairly large
independent teams. Having those teams dependant on each other kept bottlenecking them. Making them
fully independent by incorporating the whole range of expertise within the team unit was the
underlying success of microservices. It wasn't about service size, it was about contention.<p>If your org-chart is more like an onion, build your product as an onion, in layers. If your
org-chart is small and only has one or two teams, build it in just one or two parts. To maximize
success, modularize the system along the human communication boundaries.<p>Think of it like this: I communicate with myself almost infinitely fast. If you've got a partner,
you communicate so often you usually don't need to say much for the other to know what you're
thinking. If you grow to a team, you'll often talk a couple times a day. Independent teams will talk
maybe once a week or less and sometimes not at all depending on the project. Often this gets
mediated through other people which further reduces the bandwidth of the communication. Each of
these changes should be reflected in the system you build.<p>If you have more modularity than you need, you end up with waste in context switching as teams and
people keep bouncing between the components of the system. If you have less than you need, you end
up with contention, teams and people keep dropping work while waiting on others to finish things. If
your team is growing, you're always trying to Goldilocks it and you can't future proof.<p>If you're astute, this is just what human queueing theory looks like.<h2><a id=identify-and-close-open-loops href=#identify-and-close-open-loops>Identify And Close Open Loops</a></h2><p>Another branch of theory that shows up in dozens of places under different names, including
interacting with other developers is control theory. The central thesis of control theory is the
control loop. You have a control loop whenever you want to change something. Any modification at
all. That's why it keeps showing up.<p>A closed loop consists of not only modification, but also observation. If you only have
modification, it's an open loop. Any open loop is unstable and will fail at some point.<p>Examples of control theory in the social space include the
<a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OODA_loop><abbr title="Observe, Orient, Decide, Act">OODA</abbr> Loop</a>
and the
<a href=https://www.worldcat.org/title/875205252><abbr title="Objective, Reflective, Interpretive, Decisional">ORID</abbr> Method</a>.
It's why there's no such thing as the, "I'm dead," protocol both in high availability systems to
detect failure, and when you don't phone your mom and worry her sick. It's why you've got to check
that delegated work is done as you expected it to be.<p>The simplest example is a light switch. If you turn it on there's a non-zero chance the light never
actually turns on. There's usually a closed loop there though. If a human switches it and it doesn't
come on, they observe other lights nearby. If those lights are also not working, they conclude
there's a power out. If they work, they conclude the bulb burnt out. They're closing the loop.<p>Most of the code we write just assumes <code>light.on()</code> works 100% of the time. It's not just
this, but your programs are full of errors you don't check. How often do you handle memory
allocation failure? Have you ever checked to see that the <var>STDOUT</var> file descriptor was open
before you wrote to it? When you modify a file or database, are you checking that it wasn't
corrupted? When you put something in a queue, how do you know the other end is still processing?<p>When you don't close loops they're implicitly closed by a human, either your users or whoever gets
paged when it fails. This is why humans have yet to build a fully autonomous system. To do so would
require there be no path that cannot achieve the objective. When you work it out, you just find an
infinite series of progressively unlikely failure modes, ever more expensive to close without a
human.<p>A lot of people want to minimize the human in closing these loops. It's why you test your code. If
you modify the software without checking it does what you expect given some input, it's likely going
to fail. By checking you're closing the loop. When you don't check that a modification arrived at
the state you want, you might as well flip a coin. The odds are often way better than 50/50, but the
probability of failure is cumulative. That means in the limit, it is guaranteed to fail. The key is
using observation to reduce the probability so it grows as slowly as practical.<h2><a id=developing-other-developers href=#developing-other-developers>Developing Other Developers</a></h2><p>If you're focused only on the code, you're missing out on your ability to give back all the
incredible things you've taken from the development community. How much have you learned from those
who helped teach you? Are you helping to teach the next generation of developers? See about
mentoring others. Find ways to give talks. Write or record videos explaining things you've learned.
You can even build things that help others. You can do whatever you like but try to create more than
you've consumed.<p>Also remember that other people are constantly worried about what you think of them. Take some time
to admire their work. Let them know what you sincerely think. Constructive criticism is fine, but
you probably aren't taking enough time to point out the parts that you're genuinely impressed by or
that you find elegant.<p>In code reviews, people often only focus on defects or how they'd have done it differently. Spend
some time to sincerely praise things you admire from time to time. When someone goes out of their
way to improve things, go out of your way to thank them. A trick to knowing what work people care
most about is how often they talk about or share it. Knowing how often they bring it up requires
actively listening to them.<p>If you don't do small things just because big things exist you are causing more problems than you
can solve.</article></main>
