for some family this holiday season to parry the dreaded holiday tabletop routine. I think this can
be great fun if everyone's into trying to play a tabletop <abbr title="Role Playing Game">RPG</abbr>
together. Your enjoyment may vary of course, but I wanted to share the advice I gave her here in
case it proves useful to you. While <abbr title="Dungeons and Dragons">D&amp;D</abbr> isn't the
ideal tabletop <abbr title="Role Playing Game">RPG</abbr> for every group of people or occasion, it
is currently the most recognizable name in the genre. Getting people past their curious stage is
often easier when they feel at least a little familiar.<h2><a id=picking-the-module href=#picking-the-module>Picking The Module</a></h2><p>You're always free to homebrew your one-shot, but often you want to be able to show up and play
about as easily as you would another board game like Risk or Monopoly. Reading the 300 page
<abbr title="Player's Handbook"><a href=https://dnd.wizards.com/charactersheets>PHB</a></abbr> is
likely not what a curious casual player is ready to commit to just yet. They want to know what this
whole <abbr title="Dungeons and Dragons">D&amp;D</abbr> thing is about with only a little
commitment.<p>Likewise, spending a few days crafting the perfect one shot only to have your group grow bored
forty-five minutes in is going to hurt about as bad as being the first one bankrupt in Monopoly. To
simplify your work, I'd suggest picking a one page dungeon. There are many available for little to
no money. You can find everything from lovingly handcrafted award winning modules to randomly
generated freeware maps. Whatever you're most interested to run has almost certainly been built by
someone else before you. Possibly with a bit of player testing behind it to polish the design. Some
places to look online include:<ul><li><a href=https://watabou.itch.io/one-page-dungeon>One Page Dungeon Generator by watabou</a><li><a href=https://drive.google.com/file/d/1jvrAUnW0ijrl3uZHeh3AaxpxV5rlzqdc/view>One Page Adventures by Tyler Monahan</a><li><a href=https://www.dungeoncontest.com/>One Page Dungeon Contest Entries</a><li><a href=https://www.kassoon.com/dnd/one-shots/><abbr title="Dungeons and Dragons">D&amp;D</abbr> One Shot Adventures by Kassoon</a><li><a href=https://www.elventower.com/one-page-dungeons/>One Page Dungeons! by Elven Tower Adventures</a><li><a href="https://adventurelookup.com/adventures?edition=5th%20Edition&amp;numPages=%E2%89%A45">Search Adventure Lookup</a><li><a href="https://www.dmsguild.com/browse.php?filters=0_0_45393_0_0_45462_0_0&amp;keywords=%26quot%3Bone%20page%26quot%3B">Search Dungeon Master's Guild</a></ul><p>When picking, try to find an adventure that feels like it'll fill about a half to a third of the
time you intend to play. The more players you have the slower the party progresses. Ideally aim for
three to four players not including the <abbr title="Dungeon Master">DM</abbr>. Don't expect to play
for more than about four hours because after that the <abbr title="Dungeon Master">DM</abbr> will
start to feel exhausted. You'll probably complete about one encounter per hour. Encounter here could
mean combat, puzzle, or social interaction. This speed declines with each additional player. This
time also includes the time to get between each of the encounters, roleplay around the encounter,
setup, and resolution so a bunch of encounters all back to back will go faster but be careful not to
overload it. Aim for what feels like not enough because too often one-shots don't finish in time.<h2><a id=designing-the-session href=#designing-the-session>Designing The Session</a></h2><p>While 1st level characters are great for a long campaign, they can be tricky to run as a casual one
shot for new players because 1st level characters are soft and squishy. Picking something like 3rd
or 5th level means your players can feel fairly powerful, you aren't as likely to kill them with
some savage rolls, but they're not so powerful they have dozens of abilities they need to learn and
keep track of.<p>The first thing to pick will be the <abbr title="Challenge Rating">CR</abbr> of your session. This
first because it helps balance the level of the <abbr title="Player Characters">PCs</abbr> to
monsters they'll encounter. Of course this is only if your module doesn't already have this figured
out. <abbr title="Challenge Rating">CR</abbr> isn't a formula, but more a rough guide to help you
create new fights. It helps you feel confident your <abbr title="Challenge Rating">CR</abbr> 7 boss
monster with a couple <abbr title="Challenge Rating">CR</abbr> 3 minions is probably manageable but
tough for a party of four 5th level <abbr title="Player Character">PC</abbr>s. Just remember that
<abbr title="Challenge Rating">CR</abbr> doesn't predict if the encounter is fun, memorable, or
manageable. If it were, we wouldn't need a <abbr title="Dungeon Master">DM</abbr>. You can calculate
a <abbr title="Challenge Rating">CR</abbr> table using
<a href=https://donjon.bin.sh/5e/calc/enc_size.html>donjon's <abbr title="Dungeons and Dragons - 5th Edition">5e</abbr> Encounter Size Calculator</a>.<p>If your players are brand new, first encounter(s) will probably have your players taking actions
that are extremely novel until they get the hang of what's optimal in the action economy. I've had
players throw their coat to try and blind monsters, attempt to blast down chunks of the ceiling on
them, cast <a href=https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/mage-hand>Mage Hand</a> to shove them, and
spend a turn checking out what's in a nearby crate. Really try and go with these. The
<abbr title="Dungeon Master">DM</abbr>'s job is to create drama (tension and resolution) but also to
facilitate fun. You can always scale things by fudging health and damage, or just use plot to
salvage a really bad situation. It's fine for the monsters to try and take someone hostage for
ransom, have a distraction owlbear attack giving the party a chance to escape, or any other deus ex
machina to cover for a badly balanced encounter or some seriously unlucky dice.<h2><a id=creating-characters href=#creating-characters>Creating Characters</a></h2><p>When it comes to character creation for a casual one shot with novice players, the character
creation process may be a bit much. Creating characters is a lot of fun for many, but for a new
player expecting only a couple hours of fun, it may be overwhelming to spend 2 hours before the game
to create their first character. I'd suggest you come with a party of ready character sheets. You
could also write a small backstory for each to help your players get a sense of who this person is
and what their class can do. For example:<blockquote><p>Hantus Faringray, Human Bard<p>After spending the last 12 years as librarian in the service of king Daemian, I was abruptly
deposed from office. I find myself in near exile, unable to procure work. I have therefore
taken refuge within a band of mercenaries. Though of lesser pedigree, I nevertheless vowed to
aid them in their quest to explore the ancient ruins. In exchange for my inspiring insights
into the habits of local monsters, advanced fighting techniques, and arcane magics of
antiquity they have agreed to provide me part of the spoils. I fancy myself a jack of all
trades, knowledgeable about much of the world. A book may not substitute for wisdom, however,
I am confident in my abilities to inspire my new companions in the heat of battle. Besides, I
do love a good party. Not to worry though, my knowledge of
<a href=https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/vicious-mockery>Vicious Mockery</a> is always there
to aid me in case things get hairy. I did not spend that 6 month sabbatical at the college of
wizards for nothing now.</blockquote><p>This isn't the same as having them build their own character, but definitely saves hours of playing
the, <q>how to build a character,</q> <abbr title="Dungeons and Dragons">D&amp;D</abbr> pre-game.
One way to help them feel more agency though is don't give the characters all their skills/spells.
Let your players spend a bit of time looking through the
<abbr title="Player's Handbook"><a href=https://dnd.wizards.com/products/tabletop-games/rpg-products/rpg_playershandbook>PHB</a></abbr>
to personalise their character. A wizard having to pick twenty spells is going to take a while so
maybe give them <q>spell schools</q> that have a pack of spells and reduces the choice to three or
four options. You can also make up a reason that spell casters can only know their prepared spells
like the wizard having lost their book or the warlock's patron being on an interdimensional
vacation. Also, remember you don't have to make all this up yourself. There's a number of places to
find premade characters online:<ul><li><a href=https://levi-blodgett.github.io/dnd-char-generator/>Levi Blodgett's <abbr title="Dungeons and Dragons">D&amp;D</abbr> Character Generator</a><li><a href=https://www.kassoon.com/dnd/5e/premade-characters/><abbr title="Dungeons and Dragons - 5th Edition">5e</abbr> Premade Characters by Kassoon</a><li><a href=http://www.digitaldungeonmaster.com/pre-made-dd-5e-character-sheets.html>Premade Character Sheets by Digital <abbr title="Dungeon Master">DM</abbr></a><li><a href=https://dnd.wizards.com/products/tabletop-games/trpg-resources/trpg-resources>Official Pregenerated Character Sheets</a></ul><h2><a id=running-the-session href=#running-the-session>Running The Session</a></h2><p>When running encounters I highly recommend
<a href=https://www.improved-initiative.com/e/>Evan Bailey's Improved Initiative</a>. It's an
amazing shareware tool that manages to make running encounters extremely simple and efficient. If
you're using monsters not in the
<abbr title="Systems Reference Document"><a href=https://srd.dndtools.org/>SRD</a></abbr> you'll
have to manually add them yourself but once you have you can export them for later import (or login
and automatically cloud sync if you pay to support the project).<p>The only other tips I've got:<ul><li>Health is the best way to scale up and down a monster, not
<abbr title="Armour Class">AC</abbr>. Players are not having fun when they keep missing.<li>Combat works best when it lasts two to four rounds. Everyone gets a couple hits but it
doesn't drag.<li>The side that has the most attacks per round has the advantage.<li>Create exigency at the start of every player's turn in combat.</ul><table><caption>Encounter Severity</caption><thead><tr><th scope=col>Type<th scope=col>Setback<th scope=col>Dangerous<th scope=col>Deadly<tbody><tr><th scope=row>Save <abbr title="Difficulty Class">DC</abbr><td>10 to 11<td>12 to 15<td>16 to 20<tr><th scope=row>Attack Bonus<td>+3 to +5<td>+6 to +8<td>+9 to +12<tr><th scope=row>1st-4th <abbr title=Level>Lvl</abbr> <abbr title=Damage>Dmg</abbr><td>1d10<td>2d10<td>4d10<tr><th scope=row>5th-10th <abbr title=Level>Lvl</abbr> <abbr title=Damage>Dmg</abbr><td>2d10<td>4d10<td>10d10<tr><th scope=row>11th-16th <abbr title=Level>Lvl</abbr> <abbr title=Damage>Dmg</abbr><td>4d10<td>10d10<td>18d10<tr><th scope=row>17th-20th <abbr title=Level>Lvl</abbr> <abbr title=Damage>Dmg</abbr><td>10d10<td>18d10<td>24d10<tbody></table><p>For a short adventure, the focus is definitely going to be monster killing and treasure collecting.
The social and roleplay will come when they encounter a puzzle or decision they have to make in your
dungeon. The best bet is to start with the players already in front of your dungeon. Maybe even
start mid battle. A hot open can really set the right pace and tone. It also means you don't have to
use one of your encounters to start in a tavern, get them to obtain the quest, and then get them to
the dungeon. You can just give that in a blurb up front.<blockquote><p>Dealing with the town's werewolf raiders has fallen to your party. If you don't successfully
stop their return tonight by the full moon the town is surely doomed. Having infiltrated their
lair and taken care of the sentries you made your way to their outer den. Unfortunately a
wandering patrol has spotted you and raised the alarm. You're surrounded. Roll for initiative!</blockquote><h2><a id=further-reading href=#further-reading>Further Reading</a></h2><p>That's about it for a casual one shot with novices. I mean, most of this is just my opinion so
there's a lot of blog posts on the topic:<ul><li><a href=https://arcaneeye.com/dm-tools-5e/how-to-run-dnd-one-shot/>How to Run a <abbr title="Dungeons and Dragons">D&amp;D</abbr> One‑Shot</a><li><a href=https://mythcreants.com/blog/how-to-construct-a-one-shot-adventure/>How to Construct a One-Shot Adventure</a><li><a href=https://theglowingfool.com/dnd/dm-tips/preparing-a-one-shot-for-new-players/>Preparing a One-shot for New Players</a><li><a href=https://theangrygm.com/how-to-write-a-one-shot/>Ask Angry: How to Write a One-Shot</a><li><a href=https://theangrygm.com/how-not-to-teach-newbies-dd/>How NOT to Teach Newbies <abbr title="Dungeons and Dragons">D&amp;D</abbr></a></ul><p>Ultimately it's going to be a lot of contradicting advice because
<abbr title="Dungeons and Dragons">D&amp;D</abbr> is about getting a sweet spot. Enough structure
but not too much, enough drama but not too much, enough combat but not too much,
<abbr title="et cetera; and so forth">etc.</abbr> Just try to have fun with it and remember that
your players are most of the fun.</article></main>
