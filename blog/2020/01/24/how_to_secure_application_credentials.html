How do you securely manage your
credentials?<h2><a id=authentication-primer href=#authentication-primer>Authentication Primer</a></h2><p>When authenticating, you attempt to prove you are who you claim to be. This is distinct from
authorization, where you're granted permission to do certain things by whoever authenticated you.
Usually these happen back to back, so seeing a distinction can sometimes be a bit blurry. Many times
the existence of your identity in an authorization look up simultaneously authenticates you. There
are plenty of other schemes though that do have a distinction where one party attests to your
identity while another uses your identity to assign privileges.<p>For a physical example, when you make a reservation, you provide your name as a form of shared
secret. When you arrive, they first ask for your name to authenticate you made a reservation. Then
they take you to the table you're authorized to use, letting you skip the line. For a tech example,
this is how web session cookies work. Your authentication code or single sign-on provider attests to
the identity of a user based on their credentials. Once authenticated, a cookie's set in the user's
agent so following requests are tagged with the identity assertion. From then on, all your other
code can authorize privileges and private resources based on the authenticated identity.<p>When considering authentication protocols, there are generally 3 models:<ol><li><i>Something You Know</i><li><i>Something You Have</i><li><i>Something You Are</i></ol><p>Authenticating to third parties via <abbr title="Application Programing Interfaces">APIs</abbr> is
usually restricted to <i>something you know</i> (a token, password, cryptographic keys,
<abbr title="et cetera; and so forth">etc.</abbr>). In this model, it's imperative you do not allow
knowledge of the secret to be shared beyond your trust boundary. When using
<i>something you know</i>, it's possible to copy the means of authenticating indefinitely. If
control of the secret is lost, so is the means of restricting and meaningfully logging access. The
only recovery is to change the shared secret and more appropriately share and secure it going
forward.<h2><a id=threat-models-and-trust-boundaries href=#threat-models-and-trust-boundaries>Threat Models & Trust Boundaries</a></h2><p>A trust boundary is important when creating a threat model. Your threat model defines the types of
attacks you plan to consider. Without a threat model, you're just changing things. Good security
relies on defining the threat(s) your proposed change(s) mitigate. For example, you may decide your
threat model assumes the users of your system may be malicious (or not). You may decide that not
even you should be able to read users' data (or not). You may decide you will not try to secure
against malware on a machine but instead secure against it getting there in the first place (or
vise-versa).<p>All of these dramatically change the form and capabilities of the system you build. They also all
come with costs involved from engineering time and effort, to user training and support, and just
plain old system complexity. This is often why attempting to make a product secure at the end of its
development is not a smart decision. If you're design relies on insecurity you now wish to defend
against, it can actually sometimes be impossible to secure without a considerable redesign. Doing so
right at the end before launch is orders of magnitude more work than continuous consideration
throughout the project.<p>A trust boundary in your threat model defines the interface(s) between those trusted to act in the
interest of the system, and those who may be malicious. Few if any of those in an untrusted group
will be malicious, but assuming malice encourages us to verify before trusting. Why things are the
way they are is beyond the scope of this post, but can be summarized as, humans suck. As a result,
the smaller your trusted group and more accountable those inside are, the better your security.<p>However, this often comes at the cost of complexity and flexibility. Security is always about
reducing ease of use to prevent incident likelihood and remediation costs. The best security designs
are, in my opinion, near invisible to those acting in good faith. Always remember, just trusting the
operator of a system isn't enough. You also have to trust every line of code that runs on the
system(s) they use. For example, your users may not attack you, but someone subjugating their system
well may.<p>Now let's examine some of our possible solutions to the problem we started with: management of third
party credentials.<h2><a id=credential-in-source href=#credential-in-source>Credential In Source</a></h2><p>When writing code, there are a number of methods for managing credentials. The first is to put them
in the source code and/or code repository. This method is by far the easiest and most flexible,
however, it relies on secrecy of the code itself for secrecy of the credentials. Bold statement, but
this is almost always a bad idea. Unless you plan on only ever writing, storing, compiling, and
running this code on a single system, you can almost guarantee it'll be copied all over the place
without thinking about the security implications. At some point your code (and now secret
credentials) will be available to someone who really shouldn't have access.<p>For example, the moment you use a centralized repository server, anyone with access to that system,
by administrative privilege or software exploit, could potentially obtain your credentials. As
another attack, build servers (all the rage thanks to
<abbr title="Continuous Integration">CI</abbr>/<abbr title="Continuous Delivery">CD</abbr>) are
notoriously insecure as they have the challenge of isolating execution despite preserving artifacts,
all while supporting hundreds of systems, services, and tools used by developers.<p>Remember that at some point, something will have to be trusted. You can restrict all you like, but
you cannot change the fact that some piece of code or hardware will need dangerous privileges. You
can only reduce your attack surface so much. To overcome this, the best strategy is usually one that
layers defences, forcing an attacker to overcome multiple hurdles in order to be successful. Finding
a weakness in just one layer is now no longer enough, and the difficulty becomes the multiplied
challenge of overcoming each layer. To add a layer to this method, you can generally do one of two
things.<h2><a id=credential-service href=#credential-service>Credential Service</a></h2><p>One popular method is to layer <i>something you have</i> on <i>something you know</i>. An example of
this is to create or deploy a service that requires proof of ownership (<i>something you have</i>).
A common approach is using an <abbr title="Internet Protocol">IP</abbr> address allow list and
<abbr title="Transition Control Protocol">TCP</abbr>'s three way handshake as a proof of ownership
protocol. This relies on the security and stability of network routing and address assignment to
secure authentication. In this model, a single trusted third party service could contain all of the
secrets. Then, each of our services could contact this service to either obtain its credentials or
better still, have this third party authenticate or act on its behalf.<p>The biggest problems with this method are on its assumption of security critical trust in the
network and the new single point of failure. For example, it assumes you can know what
<abbr title="Internet Protocol">IP</abbr> addresses your services will be assigned and that an
attacker cannot arrange to also convince your credential service that it possesses those. The use of
static addresses are becoming generally frowned upon in an
<a href=https://stats.labs.apnic.net/ipv6><abbr title="Internet Protocol Version 6">IPv6</abbr></a>
world. Use of static addresses also makes denial of service
(<abbr title="Denial of Service">DoS</abbr>) mitigations harder. Additionally, popular services like
<a href=https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs>App Engine</a>,
<a href=https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/networking-and-content-delivery/using-static-ip-addresses-for-application-load-balancers/>Lambdas</a>,
<a href=https://www.cloudflare.com/en-ca/learning/cdn/glossary/reverse-proxy/>Cloud Workers</a>,
and other <q>serverless</q> vendors either do not allow static addresses or make using them
problematic or insecure. If you cannot trust your infrastructure treats
<abbr title="Internet Protocol">IP</abbr> addresses as security critical, you cannot trust this
method for authentication. You can add <abbr title="Domain Name System">DNS</abbr> as an abstraction
over <abbr title="Internet Protocol">IP</abbr> addresses, but now you also have to trust the
<a href=https://stats.labs.apnic.net/dnssec/>unauthenticated</a>
<a href=https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8484>unencrypted</a>
<a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNS_spoofing>poisonable</a>
<abbr title="Domain Name System">DNS</abbr> infrastructure in your security critical infrastructure.
Many other systems do rely on DNS security (like <abbr title="Transport Layer Security">TLS</abbr>
thanks to <abbr title="Automated Certificate Management Environment">ACME</abbr>), but it is still
an extra point of attack in this model.<p>One way to compensate is requiring credentials for your credential service. This has merits, but all
the same problems putting credentials in your source did in the first place. Although, you've now
just introduced a single point of failure. To understand the single point of failure, imagine what
happens if that service is unavailable. Also, if your attacker has an exploit for this system, they
may now have all of the credentials to all of your services. For a bit of history, the
<abbr title="National Security Agency">NSA</abbr> documents showed that well funded attackers
<a href=https://theintercept.com/document/2014/03/20/hunt-sys-admins/>hunt SysAdmins</a>.<p>The biggest upside to this however is key rotation. No service knows the credentials or has them
hard coded when done right. You can then generate and use new credentials automatically and
continuously. I'm not a proponent of rotating keys all the time unless they've been compromised, but
for those that are, this is often a compelling feature. Compromise by the way can just include when
someone who was trusted should no longer be (retirement, termination, resignation,
<abbr title="et cetera; and so forth">etc.</abbr>).<p>Many people go this route as an attempt at isolating developers from production. I'll just say right
now, if you can't trust your developers, hire ones you can. If I can run code on your machine, I can
do just about anything I want.<h2><a id=credential-encryption href=#credential-encryption>Credential Encryption</a></h2><p>Another method is to encrypt the credentials while they reside outside of your trust boundary but
enable those trusted to decrypt them when needed. Two popular methods for doing this include
<a href=https://www.agwa.name/projects/git-crypt/>git-crypt</a> and
<a href=https://git-secret.io/>git-secret</a>. These are convenient because they look and feel
almost identical to just putting credentials in the source code, but transparently encrypt them
whenever they sit on an untrusted computer. They also allow you to open source your code without
providing access to the secrets.<p>These work by encrypting and decrypting something from <var>STDIN</var> to <var>STDOUT</var>,
applied using
<a href=https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Customizing-Git-Git-Attributes>Git Attributes</a>.
Specifically, the clean and smudge filter attributes. Using the clean filter, a file can be modified
transparently before it is added to git's index (and subsequently committed). Using a smudge filter,
blobs in git can be transparently modified before being written into your working directory. The
subtlety here is in key management. The <q>simple</q> answer is use
<abbr title="Pretty Good Privacy">PGP</abbr>, but a deeper discussion of this solution is set for a
future post.<p>With this solution, development doesn't always require credential access. People using encrypted
versions can still use and test the software without the functionality provided by the secrets. You
can also allow users to drop in their own credentials. This means you can still have SysAdmin only
and developer only credentials if you want better production isolation.<p>While <abbr title="Pretty Good Privacy">PGP</abbr> has been around for what feels like forever, many
people still find it hard to use and unintuitive. Thankfully it's essentially set and forget. The
only complex time is when you have to create your keypair and when you create a new repo. When
you're doing routine commit cycles it can be so invisible you forget it even exists from time to
time.<p>Make sure you don't accidentally commit the credentials in the clear. This mistake is usually only
made at the start of a repo, but can happen when you overwrite credentials in a locked repo. If you
get them into your history,
<a href=https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/removing-sensitive-data-from-a-repository>getting them out</a>
is possible but a pain as you'll have to rewrite the history. I often advise just rotating the keys
when this happens to destroy the old credentials.<p>On the topic of key rotation, this method does nothing to help. You also don't gain any additional
monitoring. It doesn't provide a backup in case you forget to backup your
<abbr title="Pretty Good Privacy">PGP</abbr> keys or remember your password, nor can you see the
credentials in any sort of website based git view. You've also added another tool to your build
chain that developers will have to install, configure, update, and learn.<h2><a id=conclusion href=#conclusion>Conclusion</a></h2><p>Don't think of any as your best choice. There are a large number of considerations that make each a
good choice given a different situation. You have to think carefully about your trade offs in any
engineering decision.<p>I hope this gave you a good introduction into threat modeling, authentication schemes, security
fundamentals, and making trade offs. If you're just putting security credentials in your code, I
strongly encourage you to think critically about the long term implications that has.</article></main>
