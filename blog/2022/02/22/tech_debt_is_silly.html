This in turn
leads to some serious problems in communication. Never forget that <q>tech debt</q> is a metaphor.
Its goal is to provide some sort of analogy for a thing someone else doesn't understand. If you
cargo cult a metaphor and keep repeating it all the time, the metaphor replaces the real thing in
the audience's head.<p>Physicists deal with this all the time when dealing with invisible forces. Electricity is water in a
pipe. Uncertainty is a cat in a box. Electrons spin like little billiard balls (and have up and down
spins, funny that). These and many like them are just metaphors for real mathematical equations
describing observed phenomena. But metaphors get treated like ground truth in people's heads if they
never really learn what lies behind them. Spoiler alert, your non-technical colleagues will likely
never understand software development like you do. So repeating a metaphor is going to make your
life harder than it already is. Especially if you choose a poor metaphor.<h2><a id=comparing-real-debt-to-tech-debt href=#comparing-real-debt-to-tech-debt>Comparing Real Debt to Tech Debt</a></h2><p>Why is it a bad metaphor? What makes a good metaphor? A metaphor allows someone to link a new
concept to existing understanding by leveraging what they already understand to make assumptions
about this unfamiliar concept. Notice how that is a double edged deal. If someone's got a lay
understanding, this may work, but it often breaks down fast if the person really understands the
other concept.<p>A good metaphor then would be one that goes far on that understanding before breaking down. Tech
debt does not. Tech debt almost immediately doesn't work the same as real debt. It only barely holds
if your understanding of debt is that, <q>debt is bad,</q> and that you can sometimes say we don't
have time and move on with the assumption that you'll, <q>pay it back later.</q> So, let's examine
how debt works and how tech debt just doesn't. Here's a couple totally normal debt related things
that just don't map.<h3><a id=whats-the-roi-for-tech-debt href=#whats-the-roi-for-tech-debt>What's The <abbr title="Return on Investment">ROI</abbr> For Tech Debt?</a></h3><p>When a non-technical person thinks about debt, that immediately means it has a value. Sure a value
with amortized cost, but it implies that I can sign on for a bunch of this debt and just have the
company pay it back in the future. Yeah, business thinking people do really consider debt this way.
Debt is a way to race against return on investment and accelerate profits. The problem is these
people are not accountants. It's the bean counters job to track whether or not we can actually repay
these obligations. Debt is free money subject to accounting review.<p>This immediately runs into problems with tech debt. What's the value of this debt? I don't have a
metric to give it a debt to dollars conversion, do you? What even is a tech debt unit? How do we
quantify it? If we're going to use the language of finance to talk about developing software you
better believe there needs to be hard numbers involved.<h3><a id=hows-the-interest-rate href=#hows-the-interest-rate>How's The Interest Rate?</a></h3><p>Similarly, what's the interest rate on this debt? We haven't quantified what a debt unit is, how can
we calculate the cost of the time sink it's becoming and track it over time? Does this cost
increase? Is it linear, exponential, or constant? How does interest fluctuate? How does interest
impact yield? Interest rates are a core concept to debt but make no sense at all to technical debt.
There's no obvious comparison. Well, there is one…<p>Don't even mention bit rot. Is that different than tech debt? How is rotting related to debt?
They're completely different balance sheet items. How do digital items decay anyway? I thought only
analogue goods could. See, this simplifies nothing and is really a stretch. It's also got a
completely different name. I mean, bit rot's also a bad metaphor, but that's not this article.<p>Notice how a bad metaphor not only links incorrect assumptions to the concept, but also makes it
harder to link related concepts to the poor metaphor.<h3><a id=were-either-solvent-or-bankrupt href=#were-either-solvent-or-bankrupt>We're Either Solvent or Bankrupt</a></h3><p>Another problem with tech debt is that it implies solvency. There are higher and lower debt loads,
but as long as you keep meeting payments, you're fine. It eats into profits, but the accountants
already did the math. The debt is fine because we're likely going to make more with it than without
it. Even with a lower than projected revenue we'll have no problem paying these obligations.<p>Developers aren't making these same calculated trade-offs. We still don't have a unit for this
imaginary debt. Who's tracking if we're about to bankrupt the company by failing to meet contractual
obligations or by delivering insecure software leading to litigation? How can you express the debt
load? It's high because I feel like it's high? If an accountant tried that they'd be laughed out of
the room. If we chose financial language to describe a complexity problem, don't be surprised when
financial analysis is what people reach for to understand the problem.<p>Quick, name drop a refactor like anyone understands that and walk away.<h3><a id=bankruptcy href=#bankruptcy>Bankruptcy</a></h3><p>So you've let it snowball into full blown ball of mud and the company's technologically bust. What
do you do? Well assuming the company isn't actually bankrupt because of your poor decisions, it's
laying off many of those responsible and starting a rewrite. Yeah, rewrites turn out to be something
you can sort of indefinitely put off. Sure it takes days to do even basic things and we're now
losing a developer every other week, but that's not my problem as a non-developer. What on earth is
institutional knowledge? You'd better be documenting things down there in product development!<p>See, you're flying blind. You have no idea if you're about to bankrupt the company for failure to
meet contractual obligations. You've no idea if a competitor is about to launch a killer design that
you simply cannot pivot in time to counteroffer. There's no risk profile that a dev is about to add
an authentication bypass to your product because there's 4 different legacy authentication
<abbr title="Application Programming Interfaces">APIs</abbr> and they'll pick the wrong one for the
job.<p>If you cannot measure it, you cannot manage it.<h2><a id=the-job-shop-and-cleanliness href=#the-job-shop-and-cleanliness>The Job Shop and Cleanliness</a></h2><p>So debt barely works. What are we really trying to capture? It's the need to periodically rewrite
small chunks of the software to take advantage of what you've learned about it and what it'll need
to most likely do going forward. It's replacing 40 copy pasted chunks of code with a single
function. It's going back to fix that time you raced the clock hacking together the demo for Monday
morning last week. It's upgrading parts to take advantage of the state of the art to prevent people
tripping over the unexpectedly inconsistent behaviour.<p>After thinking about this for a while, I think a much better metaphor is working in a job shop. A
job shop is the department (on site or outsourced) in a physical engineering focused organization
where one-off or at least uncommon components are made. It's a highly flexible environment where
needs are met mostly on demand. There's a lot of machinery that often sits idle but each is vital to
executing certain types of tasks. If not managed correctly, the complexity of changing requests and
the shop itself can begin to conflict leading to inefficacy. You have to take care to fix broken
machines, but in proportion to utilization. There's trade-offs to the entire process, and all the
time you have to take workplace safety seriously.<p>I think this better captures both how developers see themselves and how non-developers see the code
monkeys. For developers, it reflects the dynamic nature of the job. The <q>hidden</q> problems
outsiders don't really see (machinery and workflows) and reflects better why it's important to take
cleanliness seriously. The metaphor is the messy job shop. When you don't take time to clean up, bad
things happen.<p>Sure, you can go fast by just leaving the scraps where they land, leaving your tools everywhere
between jobs, and just doing the minimum to get the prototype ready. Someone will end up with a
workplace injury as a result. Sure code usually doesn't maim people (robotics, defence, and some
embedded devs obviously aside), but there are definitely statistically likely consequences to
letting a code base's complexity spiral out of control.<p>For example, you don't have to take the time to remove the old authentication flows after the new
one's in place (it's a lot of work to clean up after all), but some dev will trip on it and we'll
have to deploy the public relations team to cover for us when all our customer's data hits the web.
Security degrades when developers don't fully understand what the code they're writing can do when
an attacker attempts to abuse it.<p>Another more mundane mess, it takes a dozen files over three code bases to add that button because
you have to climb over half a dozen legacy decisions that left tools in all the wrong places. All
that moving about takes time. It makes parts far more complicated and the work take much longer.
Then the workflow dictates you get others to also crawl over all that to review the changes before
we ship. If we just took time to clean up the mess, now and in the future you only need one (or
maybe two) changes to do something this simple. Remove what you no longer need to be laying around
(prevent trips and spills). Likewise, keep machines often used together, physically near (reduce the
time spent moving between parts of the code).<p>Most people can only stand working in a mess for so long. People who take pride in an orderly
environment will leave if things get too insane. Finding a zip tie holding the breaker closed after
someone used a jigsaw to cut an I-beam because the belt saw's been broken for the last month and
you're going to debate quitting to work elsewhere. Same thing if you constantly get pressured into
shipping too fast, cutting corners, and making only half understood changes to the product.<p>When people leave, they take domain expertise with them. Even if you can teach a new hire this
complex mess, it's much harder when you have to stop and explain why we keep the saws behind the
ceiling tiles. You see, it's because at one point the product… And we had to… Which meant…
Obviously! Hope you're as excited to work here as we are to have the help. No, we don't have time to
clean up the saws, now help me cut the trigger guard off this angle grinder so we can ship by end of
day.<h2><a id=there-is-such-a-thing-as-too-clean href=#there-is-such-a-thing-as-too-clean>There Is Such a Thing As Too Clean</a></h2><p>Unlike debt (where no debt is reasonable), it's not reasonable to keep the workshop a class 10,000
cleanroom capable of aerospace manufacturing unless that's what you're really doing all day. Some
systems require an extreme amount of cleanliness (human safety systems, security critical systems,
payment processing, compilers, libraries, <abbr title="et cetera; and so forth">etc.</abbr>) but
every single one still requires care and attention. Clean up the broken glass, install safety
bumpers on sharp edges, put out the spill sign to document the big stuff for now, secure the
flammables, and sweep the floors every so often.<p>Will our customers notice? Well, if you don't have time to get it right because you're actively
ignoring the mess, maybe? Other teams at other companies who keep a clean shop can just turn around
faster. You've also potentially got a talent problem. Turnover is expensive. If other shops are
tidier, where you can place your hand on a hammer when you need one, why would you keep putting up
with this nonsense? Mission sure, but your experience is dictated by the worst part. If that's hours
a day wrestling with your build systems, nobody's happy. Fix it! Passion is always noticeable in the
results.<h2><a id=conclusion href=#conclusion>Conclusion</a></h2><p>That's why I think a job shop's cleanliness is a much more apt metaphor than debt. Cleanliness is
not a business trade-off, it's a human trade-off. You trade-off safety and sanity for speed.
Cleaning up a mess that's grown out of control is much more work than cleaning as you go. There are
limits to clean, but they're best defined by those who work in it through standards and negotiation.
If we don't get it right, regulation will likely step in to cover cases where our mess is hurting
people by imposing bureaucratic checkboxes. That won't improve morale, but will reduce direct harms.
