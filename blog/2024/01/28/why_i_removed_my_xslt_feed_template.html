Template</h1><p>I've sadly stopped templating my blog feed to look pretty in a browser. But why? A combination of
Lynx, long term support worries, and user confusion.<h2><a id=lynx href=#lynx>Lynx</a></h2><p>I explicitly test my site in two classes of browsers, what I'd distinguish as application platforms
and smart document readers. The application platforms are the browsers you're probably most familiar
with. They're the ones that implement the vast majority of the
<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/?status%5B0%5D=standard"><abbr title="World Wide Web Consortium">W3C</abbr> standards</a>.
Essentially <a href=https://www.mozilla.org/en-CA/firefox/new/>Firefox</a>,
<a href=https://www.chromium.org/getting-involved/download-chromium/>Chromium</a>, and in most
cases, <a href=https://www.apple.com/ca/safari/>Safari</a>.<p>While current trends point to the list of application platform browsers ultimately just meaning
Chrome one day soon, I hold out hope that web developers will continue working to ensure their code
works on more than <s>Microsoft Windows</s>, sorry Google Chrome and users demand the same.<p>The other class are the smart document readers. These are browsers that mostly decode
<abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> documents for you. They may implement some
<abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> support and may even include some JavaScript
support. They don't see the web as an application platform, but instead see it as hyperlinked smart
documents. These are browsers like <a href=https://www.palemoon.org/>Pale Moon</a>,
<a href=https://ladybird.dev/>Ladybird</a>,
<a href=https://www.netsurf-browser.org/>NetSurf</a>,
<a href=https://kristall.random-projects.net/>Kristall</a>,
<a href=https://github.com/rkd77/elinks/>eLinks</a>,
<a href=https://lynx.invisible-island.net/>Lynx</a>, and
<a href=https://w3m.sourceforge.net/>w3m</a>.<p>I'm not going to hold myself up as some sort of user agent compatibility hero or anything. I mostly
develop in a recent version of Firefox and then double check my work in a couple other browsers. For
example I recently tested my site in NetSurf and found it was usable but ugly. I've added fixing
that to my work backlog. That aside there is one smart document browser I do explicitly support, and
that's Lynx.<p>Why Lynx? Well, I think it's the best terminal based browser, but more importantly it makes a great
accessibility target. It explicitly only looks at a site's
<abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr>. This means it doesn't force me to go out of my
way to fix things. Even the newest <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> is almost
perfectly backward compatible to the beginning of the web. In general, there's not much to
supporting it besides ensuring I don't overload the <abbr title="Document Object Model">DOM</abbr>
with junk like huge navigation menus at the top or relying on images to convey meaning. You know,
things that are considered best practices for accessibility. Essentially, by supporting Lynx, I get
accessibility nearly free. It also means I can dump my site using Lynx and pipe it through text to
speech software (something I often do to proofread my writing).<p>The ideal draw of the whole <abbr title="Extensible Stylesheet Language Transformations">XSLT</abbr>
template like this is it can seamlessly provide the data formatted as either
<abbr title="Really Simple Syndication">RSS</abbr> or
<abbr title="Extensible Hypertext Markup Language">XHTML</abbr> depending on the program looking at
it. Essentially I was hoping I could give you a copy of the data and then a set of different
rendering instructions for that data depending on context. Sort of what the web has been chasing for
decades at this point.<p>The problem is that most smart document browsers don't support
<abbr title="Extensible Stylesheet Language Transformations">XSLT</abbr>. If you try to view them in
Lynx, it tries to render the minified <abbr title="Extensible Markup Language">XML</abbr>
<abbr title="Really Simple Syndication">RSS</abbr> document by just ignoring tags it doesn't know
about (which is everything) and ends up with an unintelligible minified mess. This left me two
options, don't ship the <abbr title="Really Simple Syndication">RSS</abbr> feed minified and let
Lynx users suffer having to manually navigate past the index by copy pasting
<abbr title="Uniform Resource Locator">URL</abbr>s, or, ship the feed as a proper
<abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> page and link to the
<abbr title="Really Simple Syndication">RSS</abbr> feed. I did the second but that somewhat defeated
the entire point.<h2><a id=long-term-support href=#long-term-support>Long Term Support</a></h2><p>Another consideration that changed my mind was weighing out the likely long term support of
<abbr title="Extensible Stylesheet Language Transformations">XSLT</abbr> in browsers. If not enough
people use something or the developers of browsers just dislike it enough, history shows they will
just drop it. We've seen this with things like Gopher and
<abbr title="File Transfer Protocol">FTP</abbr> support,
<abbr title="XML User Interface Language">XUL</abbr> and
<abbr title="Cross Platform Component Object Model">XPCOM</abbr>, domain names that start with
<code>www</code>, and other such "deprecated"
<abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr>s. In general I can't stand this churn for
churn's sake, so I try and preemptively avoid things that will likely force me to do a bunch of work
at their whim.<p>I'm pretty sure <abbr title="Extensible Stylesheet Language Transformations">XSLT</abbr> in the
browser, given its relative lack of documentation compared to other browser features, and standing
contempt for <abbr title="Extensible Markup Language">XML</abbr> among developers means it isn't
long for this world. Might as well stop relying on it being there now. On the bright side, the way I
was using it means even if they remove it, it just reverts the document to the state it exists in
now without the template. It would continue to work well into the future for any reader that doesn't
apply the template transform.<p>That last point is also something worth considering a bit. What the template is doing is converting
the data from <abbr title="Really Simple Syndication">RSS</abbr>
<abbr title="Extensible Markup Language">XML</abbr> into
<abbr title="Extensible Hypertext Markup Language">XHTML</abbr>. I have yet to find an
<abbr title="Really Simple Syndication">RSS</abbr> reader that parses and applies the template to
the data before trying to interpret it, but in theory, nothing stops it from assuming that's what I
want it to do. If a reader was applying
<abbr title="Extensible Stylesheet Language Transformations">XSLT</abbr> templates to the document,
that would break my feed for them. Removing it removes that possibility.<h2><a id=user-confusion href=#user-confusion>User Confusion</a></h2><p>The last reason is ultimately the one that pushed me to remove it. I think it just added user
confusion instead of reducing it. I assume just about everyone else using
<abbr title="Really Simple Syndication">RSS</abbr> readers expect the feed to be completely unstyled
because basically nobody else styles it. When I styled the feed, I felt I had to add a paragraph
explaining, no the page you're viewing in the browser that looks like
<abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> isn't really
<abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> and will actually work in your feed reader. That
really should have been a sign that the whole project was a bad design. If you break people's
expectations, you should be doing it because there's a good reason. Design aesthetics aren't a good
reason to break things.<p>So instead of explaining that my feed that doesn't look like a feed really is a feed, I'm just going
to make it look like every one else's feed. It's simpler and expected. To quote myself,
<q cite=../../../2020/08/03/rss_as_html.html>angle brackets panic the users</q>, but
<abbr title="Really Simple Syndication">RSS</abbr> feeds that look like
<abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> pages panic them more.<h2><a id=notes-about-doing-it-yourself href=#notes-about-doing-it-yourself>Notes About Doing It Yourself</a></h2><p>I'm not going to remove my <a href=../../../2020/08/03/rss_as_html.html>previous post</a>
explaining how to use the technique. You can still (at the time of writing) try it out yourself.
Perhaps you feel differently about the benefits and drawbacks. I still think it's something worth
trying out to understand what could have been if we went with
<abbr title="Extensible Hypertext Markup Language">XHTML</abbr> instead of
<abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> 5. It's certainly not perfect, but kind of neat
to provide a suite of different rendering instructions to interpret the same data for different
contexts.</article></main>
