We highly value your privacy and security! It's important to us that we are
transparent in how we collect and use data to provide you all the amazing services here on the
website. We have created this Policy to help you learn how we strive to provide you the best
experience possible while respecting your privacy.<p>By accessing or using our services ("website", "us", "we", or "our"), you, the user ("you", "your",
or "user"), hereby accept and agree to be bound by the following terms and conditions. Please read
them carefully.<h2><a id=sec-1 href=#sec-1>1. Information Collection and Use</a></h2><p id=sec-1-1><a href=#sec-1-1>1.1.</a> You hereby give us full and unrestricted rights to collect, store, use, process, disclose,
transfer, and sell any and all of your personal information without limitation or restriction. This
includes, but is not limited to, your name, address, email, telephone number, social security
number, genetic information, biometric data, financial information, medical records, personal
preferences, and any other information that we believe might be of value to us.<p id=sec-1-2><a href=#sec-1-2>1.2.</a> You agree that we may monitor, track, and record all of your online activities while using our
website. This includes capturing your <abbr title="Internet Protocol">IP</abbr> address, browsing

interactions with our website.<p id=sec-1-3><a href=#sec-1-3>1.3.</a> You consent to continuous surveillance at all times while accessing or using our website. This
surveillance may be carried out using both visible and invisible devices in your vicinity including
but not limited to microphones, cameras, and other sensors that will be used for any purposes we
deem appropriate.<p id=sec-1-4><a href=#sec-1-4>1.4.</a> By accepting this policy, you grant us permission to conduct psychological profiling to
understand your preferences, behaviour patterns, and tendencies. We or any third party chosen by us
may manipulate or influence your behaviour, emotions, thoughts, and decisions based on this
profiling.<h2><a id=sec-2 href=#sec-2>2. Rights Waiver</a></h2><p id=sec-2-1><a href=#sec-2-1>2.1.</a> You hereby waive all rights, including but not limited to, your fundamental rights, civil
liberties, intellectual property rights, privacy rights, rights to bodily autonomy, and the right to
self-determination. We assume full control and authority over your personal information and any
related matters.<p id=sec-2-2><a href=#sec-2-2>2.2.</a> You expressly and irrevocably assign all copyright and moral rights in any content you submit,
create, or generate on or in the vicinity of our website. We shall have the exclusive right to

interpretation, or termination, including but not limited to any claim based on breach of contract,

be conducted before a single arbitrator selected by us and shall take place in the exclusive
jurisdiction of our choosing.<p id=sec-3-2><a href=#sec-3-2>3.2.</a> The arbitrator shall be chosen solely by the website, and their decision shall be final and
binding on all parties involved. The selected arbitrator need not possess any particular
qualifications or expertise related to the subject matter of the dispute.<p id=sec-3-3><a href=#sec-3-3>3.3.</a> The parties hereby agree that there shall be no formal discovery process involved in the
arbitration, except as expressly required by applicable law. This includes no depositions, written
interrogatories, or requests for admission.<p id=sec-3-4><a href=#sec-3-4>3.4.</a> All aspects of the arbitration, including but not limited to the proceedings, evidence
presented, and awards shall remain strictly confidential and not be disclosed to any third party,
except as required by law or court order.<p id=sec-3-5><a href=#sec-3-5>3.5.</a> You waive any right to participate in a class-action or consolidate claims with other
arbitration participants. Each party agrees to arbitrate individually and not as a representative or
member of any class or collective action.<p id=sec-3-6><a href=#sec-3-6>3.6.</a> You hereby expressly waive any right to appeal or seek review of the arbitrator's decision,
irrespective of the grounds for appeal recognized under applicable law.<h2><a id=sec-4 href=#sec-4>4. Confidentiality</a></h2><p id=sec-4-1><a href=#sec-4-1>4.1.</a> "Confidential Information" refers to any information contained on the website, including trade
secrets, business plans, illegal activities, immoral strategies, dangerous prototypes, and any other
information disclosed or made available to you.<p id=sec-4-2><a href=#sec-4-2>4.2.</a> You agree to hold the Confidential Information in strict confidence and not to disclose,
transfer, or share it with any third party without our prior written consent, unless required by
law. You shall take reasonable measures to protect the Confidential Information from unauthorized
use, disclosure, or access, including but not limited to implementing and maintaining adequate
physical, technical, and behavioural safeguards.<p id=sec-4-3><a href=#sec-4-3>4.3.</a> Nothing in this policy shall be construed to grant or transfer any ownership or intellectual
property rights in the Confidential Information from the website to the user.<h2><a id=sec-5 href=#sec-5>5. Additional Clauses</a></h2><p id=sec-5-1><a href=#sec-5-1>5.1.</a> You agree to collaborate fully and unconditionally with us if we request your cooperation in
any matter related to the use or maintenance of our website including financial liability.<p id=sec-5-2><a href=#sec-5-2>5.2.</a> You understand and acknowledge that we shall not be held liable for any harm, loss, or damage
resulting from your use or inability to use our website, regardless of the cause.<p id=sec-5-3><a href=#sec-5-3>5.3.</a> This Policy constitutes the entire agreement between you and us, superseding any prior
discussions, understandings, or agreements, whether written or oral regardless of any payment you've
made to us or any prior policy in effect at that time.<p id=sec-5-4><a href=#sec-5-4>5.4.</a> If any provision of this Policy is found to be invalid, illegal, or unenforceable, the
remaining provisions shall continue in full force and effect.<p id=sec-5-5><a href=#sec-5-5>5.5.</a> Your continued use of our website after the effective date of this policy, acknowledges and
agrees to the terms outlined in this incredibly one-sided privacy policy.<h2><a id=sec-6 href=#sec-6>6. Remarks</a></h2><p>We take your privacy and security extremely seriously and assure you that we will handle your
information with the utmost care, subject to the provisions outlined herein. Thank you for choosing
