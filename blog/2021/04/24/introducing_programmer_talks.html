I know it's been a long time since I've published prose. I just wanted to take some time to
introduce the <a href=../../../../talks/index.html>programmer talks</a> page I recently launched.
You may have seen it already, or you may only check this space when my
<a href=../../../index.xml><abbr title="Really Simple Syndication">RSS</abbr> feed</a> shows new
posts. Either way, I'm kind of excited to tell you about the new talks list I've created.<p>Over the last four to five years I've been slowly collecting a list of conference talks I feel are
worth sharing. I find my personal learning style favours video lectures for absorbing new
information. I'm sure others feel the same way, so I wanted to make this resource available. Problem
is, I've got a list of over 200 talks and growing I feel are worth sharing. That's kind of hard to
approach. So, I'm taking the time to build a little database of them and an interface to help find
talks you might want to watch.<p>That's fine, but I got kind of wrapped up in data entry and experimenting with the design. I've
finally just decided to launch it with whatever I had fully working. You'll probably notice there's
far fewer talks than I mentioned and there's no <abbr title="User Interface">UI</abbr> to do any of
the mentioned exploration. I promise it's all coming in due time. For now, I've pruned it to show
only the (mostly) correctly labeled talks in as bare a final product as I had fully working.<p>I've got coming changes to add a query/filtering bar to the top allowing you to prune to just
topics, authors, conferences, durations, <abbr title="et cetera; and so forth">etc.</abbr> you're
interested in. Additionally, making the navigation a bit more intuitive with things like previews
and play buttons as well as metadata links between talks and possibly a new experimental
<abbr title="Recommendation System">RecSys</abbr> I've been working on. It's a lot, so it'll
probably take some time. I may also eventually open a submission form to let you add talks you feel
passionate about. Just takes time to get it how I want it all before I ship it.<p>Hope you find the new <a href=../../../../talks/index.html>programmer talks</a> page useful.</article></main>
