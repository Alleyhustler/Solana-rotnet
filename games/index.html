I like recommending these to others in the hopes they
enjoy them too. Be sure to read <em>why</em> I recommend them. I often enjoy games that do one thing
really well at the expense of other aspects. I won't add your game to this list, so don't ask. You
may notice it doesn't have any "AAA" games from the last decade or so. I don't think marketing
budget and publication date are relevant to whether or not a game is worth playing.<h2><a id=creeper-world href=#creeper-world>Creeper World Series by Knuckle Cracker</a></h2><ve3zsh-carousel><figure><ul><li><a href=img/lg/creeper_world/4.webp><img src=img/sm/creeper_world/4.webp alt="The 3D graphics of Creeper World 4.

<a href=https://store.steampowered.com/developer/knucklecracker target=_blank>Steam</a></nav><p>Each of the Creeper World games are all essentially different takes on the same core gameplay
mechanic, an asymmetric real-time strategy game based on a fluid simulation. When I say different
takes, I mean that each game tries to reimagine the core concept under different constraints to add
a new layer of creativity to the design. For example, the original Creeper World takes place from
the top down, while Creeper World 2 takes place from the side to incorporate gravity and add an
anti-creeper mechanic. Creeper World 3 goes back to top-down, brings back the Creeper
<abbr title=versus>vs</abbr> Anti-Creeper mechanic, adds new mobile enemies, and a new type of
terrain.<p>At their core, Knuckle Cracker games are mechanics-driven games. I find them extremely fun. Part
puzzle, part power fantasy. While story battles can have all sorts of difficulty curves with sneaky
reversals, counters, unique constraints, set piece action scenes, and surprises; the procedurally
generated battles emphasize what makes the core gameplay so compelling. Each battle begins with a
plan of attack. You try to quickly capture as much territory as you can practically defend, and then
you begin to build your strength. You need to upgrade your weapons, build units that produce
resources, and watch out for unexpected weaknesses in your defences. When you have enough strength,
you begin to slowly creep into enemy territory. As you go, you continue to fortify and build, each
piece increasing the pace of your advance until your advance becomes a charge and a fait accompli.<p>When I say the games are focused on mechanics, I mean there are other elements like music, story,
graphics, juice, <abbr title="et cetera; and so forth">etc.</abbr>, but they're not what keeps me
coming back to play. The story and the writing are more flavour than fibre. Music and sound effects
are there, but mostly to fill the silence rather than a focus of the game. If you buy games for
thought provoking narrative or stunning visuals, I wouldn't recommend these to scratch that itch.<p>If you're curious but don't want to commit, the old Flash-based versions of Creeper World are
available in the Flashpoint archive. If you've played those and want more, you should definitely
consider buying a copy of <cite>Creeper World III: Arc Eternal</cite>. I've played hundreds of hours
on that one with all the community maps available and I think it's the most fleshed out of all four.<p>If the <abbr title="Two Dimensional">2D</abbr> graphics aren't your thing,
<cite>Creeper World 4</cite> is a dramatic step up in visuals to the third dimension. It's quite
nice compared to the previous instalments and even has some new ideas and changes to keep it fresh.
Unfortunately, the underlying grid meant I often positioned the camera directly overhead, recreating
a <abbr title="Two Dimensional">2D</abbr> view. It's a lot of fun, but my indifference is probably a
product of how much time I've spent with previous titles and how accustomed I've become to reading
the depth gauge.<h2><a id=tis-100 href=#tis-100><abbr title="Tessellated Intelligence System">TIS</abbr>-100 by Zachtronics</a></h2><ve3zsh-carousel><figure><ul><li><a href=img/lg/tis/1.webp><img src=img/sm/tis/1.webp alt='The TIS-100 showing the basic interface with the caption, "Rewrite corrupted code segments to repair the TIS-100".' loading=lazy height=400 width=666></a><li><a href=img/lg/tis/2.webp><img src=img/sm/tis/2.webp alt='The video console in the game for the computer with the caption, "Create your own programs in the sandbox".' loading=lazy height=400 width=666></a><li><a href=img/lg/tis/3.webp><img src=img/sm/tis/3.webp alt='Two pages of the game computer&#39;s manual splayed out with the caption, "Includes a PDF of the TIS-100 reference manual".' loading=lazy height=400 width=666></a><li><a href=img/lg/tis/4.webp><img src=img/sm/tis/4.webp alt='A diary entry world building with the caption, "Uncover the mysteries of the TIS-100".' loading=lazy height=400 width=666></a><li><a href=img/lg/tis/5.webp><img src=img/sm/tis/5.webp alt='The puzzle menu with the caption, "Includes more than 20 puzzles and 3 sandboxes".' loading=lazy height=400 width=666></a></ul></figure></ve3zsh-carousel><nav><a href=https://www.zachtronics.com/tis-100/ target=_blank>Website</a> |

programming a strange little computer in assembler. You already know if this is something you'd be
into. Seriously, if your idea of a good time is opening a real
<abbr title="Portable Document Format">PDF</abbr> programming manual to learn the instructions this
weird little virtual machine can execute to solve programming problems, look no further.<p>I like programming, and now that I work as a programmer, I have a messed up relationship with the
joy I used to find in it. This allowed me to get some of it back. It's a world where programming
isn't a trillion dollar industry. You're not just a middleman between a text editor and a search
engine or chatbot. You don't have a thousand tools and libraries to haphazardly cobble together.
There are no thought leaders espousing their one true religion of development practice. There's no
tech debt, no office politics, no deadlines, no compromises, no meetings, nobody else's mistakes to
clean up. Just you, the machine, the problem, and the reference manual.<p>What's more, statistics about your solution, such as how many instructions you used, how many nodes
were involved, or how long it took to execute, are collected and compared to everyone else's
solutions. Since the solutions are trivially verifiable by the leader board server, there's nobody
who's solution runs in 0.1 seconds with 1 instruction. This allows you to challenge yourself, to
reconsider your solution and squeeze it to improve.<p>If you're curious, the
<a href=https://www.zachtronics.com/images/TIS-100P Reference Manual.pdf><cite><abbr title="Tessellated Intelligence System">TIS</abbr>-100 Reference Manual</cite></a>
is available online at the <a href=https://www.zachtronics.com/>Zachtronics</a> website. You'll
have to read the manual to play the game anyway. Why not read it first to see if it sparks some joy?<h2><a id=antichamber href=#antichamber>Antichamber by Alexander Bruce</a></h2><ve3zsh-carousel><figure><ul><li><a href=img/lg/antichamber/1.webp><img src=img/sm/antichamber/1.webp alt="The strange hypercube beyond moving floors and green particles." loading=lazy height=400 width=711></a><li><a href=img/lg/antichamber/2.webp><img src=img/sm/antichamber/2.webp alt="The strange hypercube in a hallway." loading=lazy height=400 width=711></a><li><a href=img/lg/antichamber/3.webp><img src=img/sm/antichamber/3.webp alt="A puzzle with a couple of the blue cubes and closed doors." loading=lazy height=400 width=711></a><li><a href=img/lg/antichamber/4.webp><img src=img/sm/antichamber/4.webp alt="An extremely colourful room with a few crates and windows to other rooms beyond." loading=lazy height=400 width=711></a><li><a href=img/lg/antichamber/5.webp><img src=img/sm/antichamber/5.webp alt="A puzzle involving green cubes and a laser grid." loading=lazy height=400 width=711></a><li><a href=img/lg/antichamber/6.webp><img src=img/sm/antichamber/6.webp alt="Red cubes through purple forcefield in the shape of the letters WTF!?." loading=lazy height=400 width=711></a></ul></figure></ve3zsh-carousel><nav><a href=http://antichamber-game.com/ target=_blank>Website</a> |
<a href=https://store.steampowered.com/app/219890/Antichamber/ target=_blank>Steam</a></nav><p><cite>Antichamber</cite> is a first-person puzzle game. That's not why I recommend it. Instead, the
game is a puzzle game in a world that routinely defies the laws of Euclid, stylized with some of the
coolest shader art in video games. Kind of like playing <cite>The Stanley Parable</cite> and
<cite>Portal</cite> at the same time, without a narrator, while the hue and contrast controls freak
out in a good way.<p>There's no plot or story, just a world to explore and experience as you overcome the puzzling
obstacles in your path. You just start walking around, and almost immediately the world shows you
that every expectation you have about how physical space works doesn't apply in the antichamber.
After toying with you the game begins to slowly introduce mechanics. I found that most of the
puzzles have that wonderful sense of "Ah, ha!" where once you know the solution, it doesn't drag on
unnecessarily. Soon you'll find the manipulation tool that allows you to pick up and place the
colourful blocks of the world, and from there you're off on an adventure.<p>The game has an ending. It's visual and beautiful, but it was also kind of sad. You know it means
it's over. You've experienced all the visual delights and wondrous geometry that the game has to
offer. This game is an experience. It doesn't try to take hundreds of hours to play, and I'm very
grateful for that. I find that too many games drag on until they're no longer fun, and I'm left to
either push through with brute force or I just give up. Not this one.<p>It's a game that really explores the possibilities of video game world design. It clearly shows you
that video game worlds don't have to follow the same rules that govern our own. That it's not
necessary to push harder and harder for realism and immersion, and that trying to make a video game
mimic the real world is but a fraction of what they have to offer.<h2><a id=evoland href=#evoland>Evoland by Shiro Games</a></h2><ve3zsh-carousel><figure><ul><li><a href=img/lg/evoland/1.webp><img src=img/sm/evoland/1.webp alt="How it starts with little more than the ability to move left and right in a monochrome grid." loading=lazy height=400 width=711></a><li><a href=img/lg/evoland/2.webp><img src=img/sm/evoland/2.webp alt="The moment you get free movement in full colour." loading=lazy height=400 width=711></a><li><a href=img/lg/evoland/3.webp><img src=img/sm/evoland/3.webp alt="You can buy and sell items at a merchant with dialogue menus." loading=lazy height=400 width=711></a><li><a href=img/lg/evoland/4.webp><img src=img/sm/evoland/4.webp alt="You and your party in timer driven turn based combat." loading=lazy height=400 width=711></a><li><a href=img/lg/evoland/5.webp><img src=img/sm/evoland/5.webp alt="The game when it's in full 3D as you traverse lava and fireballs in a dungeon." loading=lazy height=400 width=711></a><li><a href=img/lg/evoland/6.webp><img src=img/sm/evoland/6.webp alt="Forced prospective prerendered background city complete with other animated NPCs walking around." loading=lazy height=400 width=711></a></ul></figure></ve3zsh-carousel><nav><a href=https://evoland.shirogames.com/ target=_blank>Website</a> |

<a href=https://store.steampowered.com/app/1020470/Evoland_Legendary_Edition/ target=_blank>Steam</a></nav><p>Ever wanted a crash course through the artistic and mechanical elements of early Zelda and Final
Fantasy games and their clones? This game essentially plays out what that looked like, with some
flair of its own. I like to think of it as the game design equivalent of Coles Notes. In this case,
of course, because it's about games and not books, it's a game and not a book.<p>If you want a mechanically deep game or a game with a complex narrative, this is not the game for
you. It's very one-dimensional. You go on an unspecified adventure until you find out there's a
BigBad™. Defeat it and the world is safe. Mechanically, it's all rudimentary versions of the
mechanics from the source material it's based on. They could use more polish, but the game is also
constantly throwing away art and engine code that any other game would reuse and build upon. I'm not
surprised that compromises were made in the feel of something that the player will experience for
maybe twenty minutes. Don't get me wrong, it would be nice to have a deeper game, but I still
recommend it.<p>I find this game interesting as a concept. For those who study game design, I think it's a great
piece to think about how upgrades in technology often present trade-offs. There will be some
upgrades you unlock that you wish you could undo because they take away something you enjoyed. Much
like fans who wish the new game didn't remove that thing they enjoyed from the last one. If you
engage it critically, it helps you appreciate what you can dissect when you bring so many styles
together in one game.<h2><a id=muse-dash href=#muse-dash>Muse Dash by PeroPeroGames</a></h2><ve3zsh-carousel><figure><ul><li><a href=img/lg/muse/1.webp><img src=img/sm/muse/1.webp alt="One of the many pieces of artwork through the game of the main characters." loading=lazy height=400 width=711></a><li><a href=img/lg/muse/2.webp><img src=img/sm/muse/2.webp alt="Some typical gameplay perfectly hitting a sustained note with a combo of almost 200." loading=lazy height=400 width=711></a><li><a href=img/lg/muse/3.webp><img src=img/sm/muse/3.webp alt="The track select interface." loading=lazy height=400 width=711></a><li><a href=img/lg/muse/4.webp><img src=img/sm/muse/4.webp alt="One of the wild twists in a stage." loading=lazy height=400 width=711></a><li><a href=img/lg/muse/5.webp><img src=img/sm/muse/5.webp alt="The same twist but where the stage boss has had enough of you." loading=lazy height=400 width=711></a><li><a href=img/lg/muse/6.webp><img src=img/sm/muse/6.webp alt="Final score screen with a decent but new best A rating." loading=lazy height=400 width=711></a><li><a href=img/lg/muse/7.webp><img src=img/sm/muse/7.webp alt="The track leaderboard and difficulty selection." loading=lazy height=400 width=711></a><li><a href=img/lg/muse/8.webp><img src=img/sm/muse/8.webp alt="So many collectibles." loading=lazy height=400 width=711></a><li><a href=img/lg/muse/9.webp><img src=img/sm/muse/9.webp alt="Track expansion packs." loading=lazy height=400 width=711></a></ul></figure></ve3zsh-carousel><nav><a href=https://musedash.peropero.net/ target=_blank>Website</a> |

<a href=https://store.steampowered.com/app/2593750/Muse_Dash__Muse_Plus/ target=_blank>Steam (full)</a></nav><p>I don't play a lot of rhythm games, but I really like this one. It has only two controls, just up
and down with the left and right set of homerow keys. While seasoned rhythm gamers may find such
simplicity too basic, I find it quite nice to relax. Great music, cute anime, over-the-top visuals,
quirky levels. It's a balance that makes for a fun game to just jam to.<p>There are mobile versions, and that helps explain why the controls are so simple on the surface.
Underneath, though, the controls expect you to use multiple fingers for each side to hit the fast
note sequences and combos when you get to advanced difficulties. Unfortunately, this means that you
can go a long way with just two fingers, but at some point, if you want to keep pushing yourself,
it'll just be too fast to keep up and you'll have to completely relearn how to play multi-finger. On
the other hand, if you're not a speed demon you can enjoy just about any track with just two fingers
if you stick to easier difficulties.<p>I haven't played it on mobile, but on desktop it's sold in two parts. There's the fairly inexpensive
base game and then a much more expensive single <abbr title="Downloadable Content">DLC</abbr> that
bundles all the track packs together. The base game offers a solid set of tracks that ramp up in
difficulty, culminating in a sort of hardest of the lot boss-like level. It's a great experience and
can be the only thing you play if you want. Every day they also make one of the
<abbr title="Downloadable Content">DLC</abbr> tracks available for those who only have the base
game.<p>Having a cheap game and single expensive content pack is definitely a choice that can have mixed
feelings. Especially if you don't know about it until after you buy the base game. Feels like a bait
and switch. So I want to be sure you know about it. I personally love that there's just one big
purchase if you decide you want more songs instead of several individual packs dividing up that
cost. It feels nice that there's a full purchase price. I'm kind of tired of confusing tiers,
pointless cosmetics, and a never ending series of <abbr title="Downloadable Content">DLC</abbr>
chopping the game up and selling it in pieces.<p>I also liked being able to pick the base game up for a few bucks. Expensive games you end up not
really enjoying aren't fun either. Having played with the expansion for a while now, I think the
base game is great all on its own. It does remind you about the expansion in places, but you really
don't need it to have a good time. It's just more songs. You aren't missing much.<h2><a id=terraria href=#terraria>Terraria by Andrew Spinks</a></h2><ve3zsh-carousel><figure><ul><li><a href=img/lg/terraria/1.webp><img src=img/sm/terraria/1.webp alt="Fighting the Brain of Cthulhu." loading=lazy height=400 width=565></a><li><a href=img/lg/terraria/2.webp><img src=img/sm/terraria/2.webp alt="A castle and house built in the snow." loading=lazy height=400 width=565></a><li><a href=img/lg/terraria/3.webp><img src=img/sm/terraria/3.webp alt="Cannon fight over a desert pond." loading=lazy height=400 width=565></a><li><a href=img/lg/terraria/4.webp><img src=img/sm/terraria/4.webp alt="Fishing at night off a dock." loading=lazy height=400 width=565></a><li><a href=img/lg/terraria/5.webp><img src=img/sm/terraria/5.webp alt="A fireworks display over a couple NPC houses." loading=lazy height=400 width=565></a><li><a href=img/lg/terraria/6.webp><img src=img/sm/terraria/6.webp alt="A sky house high in the clouds." loading=lazy height=400 width=565></a><li><a href=img/lg/terraria/7.webp><img src=img/sm/terraria/7.webp alt="Simple starter home with the guide." loading=lazy height=400 width=565></a><li><a href=img/lg/terraria/8.webp><img src=img/sm/terraria/8.webp alt="Fighting the Pumpking with a bunch of the cool costume drops on mannequins below." loading=lazy height=400 width=565></a><li><a href=img/lg/terraria/9.webp><img src=img/sm/terraria/9.webp alt="Taking on Plantera deep in the jungle underground." loading=lazy height=400 width=565></a></ul></figure></ve3zsh-carousel><nav><a href=https://www.terraria.org/ target=_blank>Website</a> |

<cite>Terraria</cite>. If you've played <cite>Starbound</cite> but not <cite>Terraria</cite>, it's
like that, but made with passion instead of grift, so it has an order of magnitude more content for
half the price.<p><cite>Terraria</cite> is a game designed and largely built by Andrew "Redigit" Spinks. It still is,
over a decade and a half later. I don't want to diminish the work of the many amazing people who
<a href=https://www.terraria.org/credits>work on the game at Re-Logic</a>, or those who started
the game. They've helped create something incredible by combining ideas and talents. It's not a solo
dev game, but it's a game that's had someone's care and attention all its life.<p>It's $10, and for that you get a game with hundreds of hours of things to explore and do. Not a
procedurally generated roguelike replay loop. Not a sandbox where you try to make your own fun. No,
a world filled with a crafted narrative experience based on a progression of events, enemies, and
boss fights. Places to explore with surprises to discover. An entire interconnected crafting tree
that builds and evolves over the course of the game, allowing you to make weapons that feel fun and
exciting to wield, and armour and outfits that look good doing it.<p>It's a game a mile wide and a dozen leagues deep, with systems that build upon systems. A game where
most things that exist have lots of variations so you can pick the ones that fit your style,
personality, or mood, but more importantly, many have unique systems or features so they're not just
reskins with bigger numbers. Even now, they're working on world generation code to add bazaar new
worlds to explore, meaning the system will mix back on the other existing systems to let you
discover all sorts of novelties in what's possible.<p>Explore how? Well, <cite>Terraria</cite> has one of the rare systems in games where player
characters are independent of a game world. You have characters and worlds. You can have your
character travel to different game worlds if you want. To join multiplayer games with all the gear
and items you bring in your inventory to show off and to bootstrap the party. To take them to worlds
of intense difficulty and try to get loot that is exclusive to that level of challenge. I haven't
played a game like that since <cite>Diablo II</cite>. Too many games worry about balance or
cheating. <cite>Terraria</cite> is content to just let you have fun. You're only cheating yourself.<p>It also gets a lot of things right that its competitors do not. The intended experience is that you
only drop half your money when you die and not your whole inventory, making it painful but not
frustrating. There are no durability mechanics on tools or weapons that leave you stranded in a
fight or pointlessly making a dozen of something to make it last. Its
<abbr title="Two Dimensional">2D</abbr> graphics mean you can navigate the world more easily,
knowing what's on the other side of a wall, while also making it faster to create new content for
the game, spending less time on art and more time on gameplay.<h2><a id=dark-echo href=#dark-echo>Dark Echo by RAC7</a></h2><ve3zsh-carousel><figure><ul><li><a href=img/lg/dark_echo/1.webp><img src=img/sm/dark_echo/1.webp alt="What it looks like to clap before the echos bounce off walls." loading=lazy height=400 width=711></a><li><a href=img/lg/dark_echo/2.webp><img src=img/sm/dark_echo/2.webp alt="Walking in a room with some sort of enemy chasing you." loading=lazy height=400 width=711></a><li><a href=img/lg/dark_echo/3.webp><img src=img/sm/dark_echo/3.webp alt="Footstep echos show you in a narrow hallway of some sort that opens into a large space." loading=lazy height=400 width=711></a><li><a href=img/lg/dark_echo/4.webp><img src=img/sm/dark_echo/4.webp alt="The puzzle selection screen." loading=lazy height=400 width=711></a><li><a href=img/lg/dark_echo/5.webp><img src=img/sm/dark_echo/5.webp alt='This is a level opening for level 1, "Blind", but it&#39;s mysteriously in white and not black...' loading=lazy height=400 width=711></a></ul></figure></ve3zsh-carousel><nav><a href=https://darkechogame.com/ target=_blank>Website</a> |

to dodge enemies and avoid traps while finding the way to open locked doors, all without ever seeing
any of it. It has the really cool idea to represent instead the sounds that emanate and reflect from
the surfaces around you. Using colour to indicate enemies in red, water in blue, and buttons in
yellow. It's a fantastic concept and I love every minute of it.<p>The difficulty of the game is mixed. There are sections that require many attempts to get through.
It's not an extremely long experience, but there are a few dozen puzzles to solve. More than enough
for the price. I love this game most of all for its originality.<h2><a id=factorio href=#factorio>Factorio by Wube Software</a></h2><ve3zsh-carousel><figure><ul><li><a href=img/lg/factorio/1.webp><img src=img/sm/factorio/1.webp alt="Your ship crash lands." loading=lazy height=400 width=711></a><li><a href=img/lg/factorio/2.webp><img src=img/sm/factorio/2.webp alt="Start by building a small spaghetti base." loading=lazy height=400 width=711></a><li><a href=img/lg/factorio/3.webp><img src=img/sm/factorio/3.webp alt="Build a wall to defend against the biters.

<a href=https://store.steampowered.com/app/427520/Factorio/ target=_blank>Steam</a></nav><p>I'm a computer programmer. I kind of have to like this game. Not really, of course, but yeah, this
game is a ton of fun if you like to automate things. While in many games automating things like
getting money or resources is either a dirty secret or an outright cheat, in <cite>Factorio</cite>
it's the intended experience.<p>What impresses me the most is how the game manages to handle the millions of entities you're moving
around without breaking a sweat. I mean, it's possible with a mega factory to push the limits of
what your computer can handle, but this game has a level of optimization that few game developers
are even capable of (or at least bothering with) anymore. It's really impressive engineering.<p>If you're not a programmer, but want something that gives you the real experience of having to go
back and fix things that turn out to be a problem as you continue to expand and add more and more to
your project, this is the game. While other games will teach you algorithmic thinking, Boolean
logic, or other software fundamentals, this is the only game that really captures what it's like to
work on a long-lived software project.<p>The modding community for this game is also incredible. The game has an impressive collection of
mods that expand the number of recipe chains and toys to play with. I mean, just look at
<a href=https://mods.factorio.com/highlights>the highlights page</a>. If you manage to launch a
rocket, which is no small feat, you can go on to levels of automation that only the truly insane
dare to orchestrate.<p>One of the other interesting things about this game is that it never goes on sale. The game has only
gotten more expensive over time as it moved out of early access and gained more features and polish.
The developers feel that discounting it would essentially rob those who bought early. It would also
be a psychological trick to get you to buy it. They just want an honest deal. I admire that.<h2><a id=hook href=#hook>Hook by Maciej Targoni</a></h2><ve3zsh-carousel><figure><ul><li><a href=img/lg/hook/1.webp><img src=img/sm/hook/1.webp alt="A fairly early puzzle with just 3 buttons." loading=lazy height=400 width=711></a><li><a href=img/lg/hook/2.webp><img src=img/sm/hook/2.webp alt="This puzzle has a beautiful symmetry to it." loading=lazy height=400 width=711></a><li><a href=img/lg/hook/3.webp><img src=img/sm/hook/3.webp alt="A complex puzzle with wireless links.

<a href=https://store.steampowered.com/app/367580/Hook/ target=_blank>Steam</a></nav><p>How about a puzzle game that has been beautifully reduced to almost nothing? <cite>Hook</cite> is a
puzzle game designed to look like an electronic circuit diagram. Your job is to pull the hooks and
pins apart by sending signals through a mess of tangled wires.<p>No timers, no scores, and no fancy animations. Just a simple puzzle. Follow the wires, figure out
what button connects to what. Figure out where all the dials go. Then push the button and hope you
didn't miss anything. It's as beautiful as it is simple. It's just a joy to interact with. The sound
design is exquisite, with satisfying buttons and a clunk when you've screwed up that makes you slap
your forehead for missing it. The atmosphere is serene.<h2><a id=fallout-new-vagus href=#fallout-new-vagus>Fallout: New Vagus by Obsidian Entertainment</a></h2><ve3zsh-carousel><figure><ul><li><a href=img/lg/new_vagus/1.webp><img src=img/sm/new_vagus/1.webp alt="That Gun pointed nowhere in particular, wandering the wasteland." loading=lazy height=400 width=711></a><li><a href=img/lg/new_vagus/2.webp><img src=img/sm/new_vagus/2.webp alt="A look at the Pip-Boy and the New Vagus world map." loading=lazy height=400 width=711></a><li><a href=img/lg/new_vagus/3.webp><img src=img/sm/new_vagus/3.webp alt="V.A.T.S. targeting Veronica's head, who's warning a full set of power armour." loading=lazy height=400 width=711></a><li><a href=img/lg/new_vagus/4.webp><img src=img/sm/new_vagus/4.webp alt="The gate welcoming you to The Strip under heavy guard in Freeside." loading=lazy height=400 width=711></a><li><a href=img/lg/new_vagus/5.webp><img src=img/sm/new_vagus/5.webp alt='A bartender at the Ultra-Luxe wearing a White Glove Society mask saying it was a, "Pleasure speaking to you."' loading=lazy height=400 width=711></a><li><a href=img/lg/new_vagus/6.webp><img src=img/sm/new_vagus/6.webp alt="A movie playing about a child.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gzF7aHxk4Y4">hbomberguy's video essay</a> yet, it's well
worth the time. It covers a lot of the reasons why this game is a joy to play and how it can really
challenge you to think about things.<p>It's one of the few games that has ever really forced me to think critically about and defend things
I believe in. It does that all the time. Just as an example, I think education is probably the
greatest thing humans have ever invented. The ability to pass on what you have learned to others is
a true multiplier of human potential. Coupled with the scientific method of arriving at the truth of
things, this has really been the driving force of the last couple centuries' gains in human living
conditions.<p>The game has a faction called the Followers of the Apocalypse. An anarcho-humanitarian
quasi-religious organization that focuses on science, education, research, and medical services. I
don't want to unpack that word soup too much, but basically imagine a group that uses the
iconography of religion, but where divinity has been replaced by scientific research and the ideals
of faith by thought have been eliminated, leaving only faith by works. Sounds ideal, right? A loose
association of people who just want to help educate people as much as possible to make the world a
better place. What could possibly go wrong?<p>Well, meet the Great Khans, a raiding faction known for producing and selling vast amounts of
narcotics in the wastelands and directly responsible for supplying the drugged out murderous faction
called the Fiends. Guess who they learned their chemistry from.<p>If you need more, meet Caesar's Legion, one of the game's core factions and one that is attempting
to remake civilization in the image of the Roman Empire under fascism by embarking on a military
campaign of genocide, enslaving those deemed useful, subjugating young boys impressionable enough
for military integration, and gruesomely killing the rest as a warning to any dissenters. Guess
where Edward "Caesar" Sallow learned about the Greco-Raman world on which to base his empire. Better
yet, he was once a member of the Followers.<p>Welcome to the dark side of education. If you don't indoctrinate people, they can do morally
repugnant things with what you teach them. Does this mean that we should only indoctrinate people?
Should we guard knowledge to prevent its misuse? Now just imagine that challenge to your ideals
playing out again and again, subject by subject.<h2><a id=toki-tori-2 href=#toki-tori-2>Toki Tori 2+ by Two Tribes</a></h2><ve3zsh-carousel><figure><ul><li><a href=img/lg/toki/1.webp><img src=img/sm/toki/1.webp alt="Trapped in a bubble you float up to access a ledge." loading=lazy height=400 width=711></a><li><a href=img/lg/toki/2.webp><img src=img/sm/toki/2.webp alt="A bloated frog to your left, a ladder to your right." loading=lazy height=400 width=711></a><li><a href=img/lg/toki/3.webp><img src=img/sm/toki/3.webp alt="A dark room lit only by a red light.

<a href=https://store.steampowered.com/app/201420/Toki_Tori_2/ target=_blank>Steam</a></nav><p>You can conquer the entire game from the beginning if you understand how each mechanic works. But
you don't, so you have to explore and let the game teach you by observing how everything around you
interacts. In <cite>Toki Tori 2+</cite> you only have two controls, stomp and chirp. No jumping, no
dashing, and no flying. Just stomp and chirp.<p>The game is very cute and accessible. There's no dialogue or writing, so children and those with
limited literacy in any of the supported languages should be able to play comfortably. The music is
generally upbeat and happy. It has a lot of Saturday morning cartoon camp. I'd call it a children's
puzzle game, but describing media as child-friendly or for children often implies an odour of
garbage that this game simply does not have.<p>Yes, it's another puzzle game. But it's a puzzle game that focuses on your ability to watch and
learn, because it follows the best rule in movies and games: "Show! Don't tell."<h2><a id=vampire-survivors href=#vampire-survivors>Vampire Survivors by Luca Galante</a></h2><ve3zsh-carousel><figure><ul><li><a href=img/lg/vampire/1.webp><img src=img/sm/vampire/1.webp alt="All the power-ups." loading=lazy height=400 width=711></a><li><a href=img/lg/vampire/2.webp><img src=img/sm/vampire/2.webp alt="The bestiary." loading=lazy height=400 width=711></a><li><a href=img/lg/vampire/3.webp><img src=img/sm/vampire/3.webp alt="Achievements yet to obtain." loading=lazy height=400 width=711></a><li><a href=img/lg/vampire/4.webp><img src=img/sm/vampire/4.webp alt="Secret spells?" loading=lazy height=400 width=711></a><li><a href=img/lg/vampire/5.webp><img src=img/sm/vampire/5.webp alt="A rink of pickups surrounds you as monsters close in on all sides.

games until just the act of existing is fun, you get this game. You're the epicentre of a bullet
hell storm. Hordes of enemies swarm you while your arsenal of weapons cuts through them like hot
butter. As you collect experience gems, you level up to add even more weapons and damage to your
arsenal. Every also-ran slop shop has put out a clone, so you know it must be good.<p>You start out dodging and weaving, avoiding enemies as you try to survive with just one or two
underpowered weapons. Eventually you get overrun and fail. As you get better and better, learning
the best weapon combos and tactics, you eventually manage to hold out until only death itself can
take you down. Or can it? In <cite>Vampire Survivors</cite>, you may even be able to defeat death.
No one lives forever, but the truly prepared can fight to the bitter end.<p>This game is super fun if you love achievement hunting. There are hundreds of them. All of them are
reasonable to obtain. It's a lot of fun to work your way through them. For a few bucks, you can see
what a game that focuses solely on being fun is like.</article></main>
